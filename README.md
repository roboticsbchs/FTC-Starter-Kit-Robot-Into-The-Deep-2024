# Starter Kit Robot Example Code
Example Code for the Starter Robot built out of the [goBILDA Starter Kit]([url](https://www.gobilda.com/ftc-starter-kit-2024-2025-season/)) for the 2024-2025 FIRST Tech Challenge INTO THE DEEP season. <br><br>
It includes options for Android Studio, and Onbot Java (using the same Java file in teamCode).
